# Documentation Archive

This folder contains documentation files that were archived during the transition to release-ready documentation following the Diátaxis framework.

## Archived Planning Documents

The following files were moved from active documentation as they primarily served development planning purposes rather than end-user documentation:

### Sprint and Development Planning (`planning/`)
- `SPRINT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Sprint-by-sprint implementation tracking
- `upgrade-plan.md` - 90-day development roadmap with sprint structure
- `backlog.md` - Development backlog and task tracking
- `gap-analysis.md` - Technical gap analysis and remediation plans
- `pr-blueprints.md` - Pull request templates and implementation plans
- `open-questions.md` - Development decisions and clarifications
- `Prelight.md` - Development tasking document
- `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Enterprise feature gap analysis
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation status summary
- `ENHANCED_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Enhanced feature implementation details
- `EXPERTISE_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Expert system implementation
- `ALPHA_READINESS_SUMMARY.md` - Alpha release readiness assessment

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files served important purposes during development but are not appropriate for end-user documentation:

1. **Sprint Terminology**: References to "Sprint 0-9" and development phases that don't align with release-based versioning
2. **Planning Focus**: Primary purpose was development coordination rather than user guidance
3. **Implementation Details**: Low-level technical implementation notes rather than user-facing documentation
4. **Development Status**: Time-sensitive status updates that become outdated

## Preserved Content

Important technical information from these files has been:
- **Extracted and integrated** into the new Diátaxis-structured documentation
- **Updated with release terminology** (e.g., "since v0.1.0" instead of "Sprint 2")
- **Reorganized** into appropriate categories (Tutorials, How-to, Reference, Explanation)

## Legacy Documentation

The existing `legacy/` folder continues to contain older documentation files that were superseded by previous reorganization efforts.

## If You Need Archived Content

If you need information from these archived files:

1. **Check the new documentation first** - Most useful content has been migrated and improved
2. **Search in appropriate sections** - Use the new Diátaxis structure to find reorganized content
3. **File an issue** if important content is missing from the new documentation
