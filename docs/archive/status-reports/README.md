# Archived Status Reports

This directory contains historical status reports and analysis documents that have been superseded by the single source of truth: **[Upgrade.md](../../../Upgrade.md)**.

## Files Archived

- **FINAL_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Historical gap analysis claiming 89% completion
- **FRONTIER_ANALYSIS.md** - Historical frontier capabilities analysis  
- **DOCS_REPORT.md** - Documentation cleanup report

## Reason for Archiving

These documents created confusion by having conflicting completion percentages and status assessments. To maintain a single source of truth and prevent regression, all implementation status and roadmap information has been consolidated into:

**[ðŸ“Š Implementation Status & Roadmap](../../../Upgrade.md)**

This single document provides:
- âœ… Code-verified implementation status (95% complete)
- âœ… Accurate sprint-by-sprint analysis  
- âœ… Critical TODOs and dependency requirements
- âœ… Strategic roadmap and enhancement opportunities
- âœ… Honest assessment based on actual codebase analysis
