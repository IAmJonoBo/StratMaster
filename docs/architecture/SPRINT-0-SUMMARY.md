**Impact**: Enables Sprint 2 dependency modernization work

### QA-001: Test Coverage Benchmarking & Test Data Audit ✅
**Document**: `docs/architecture/QA-001-test-coverage-audit.md`

**Key Findings**:
- **18 Test Directories**: 55% of packages have test infrastructure (18/33)
- **37 Test Files Total**: Average 2.1 test files per tested package
- **15 Packages Untested**: 45% of packages lack testing (HIGH RISK)
- **Strong API Coverage**: 11 comprehensive tests in core API package

**Impact**: Roadmap for Sprint 3 testing expansion to 90% coverage target

### OPS-001: CI/CD & Virtual Environment Baseline Analysis ✅
**Document**: `docs/architecture/OPS-001-cicd-baseline.md`

**Key Findings**:
- **10 GitHub Actions Workflows**: Sophisticated but complex CI/CD infrastructure
- **Optimization Potential**: 30-50% build time reduction opportunity identified
- **Environment Complexity**: ~5 minute setup time with caching opportunities  
- **Quality Gates Present**: Security, accessibility, deployment validation

**Impact**: Clear path to 30% build time reduction target in Sprint 4

## Quality Gates Met

### Sprint 0 Success Criteria ✅

- **Build Optimization**: Multiple specific optimization paths identified
- **Test Expansion**: Clear package-by-package testing roadmap

## Risks Identified & Mitigated

### High Risks Identified
1. **Dependency Version Conflicts** - Mitigated by consolidation plan
2. **15 Untested Packages** - Mitigated by Sprint 3 testing expansion plan  
3. **Build Complexity** - Mitigated by Sprint 4 CI/CD optimization plan

### Medium Risks Identified
1. **Module Interdependencies** - Mitigated by interface contract strategy
2. **External API Dependencies** - Mitigated by abstraction layer recommendations
3. **Environment Setup Complexity** - Mitigated by caching and automation plans

## Sprint 1 Readiness

### Immediate Next Steps Ready for Execution
