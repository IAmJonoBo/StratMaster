## Virtual Environment Analysis

### Current Setup Complexity

#### Environment Creation Patterns
```yaml
# Pattern observed across workflows:
- name: Setup Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v6
  with:
    python-version: '3.13'

- name: Create venv
  run: python -m venv .venv

- name: Install dependencies  
  run: |
    .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Identified Issues
1. **Repeated Environment Setup**: Each workflow creates fresh environments
2. **Dependency Installation**: No caching of dependency installations
3. **Package Complexity**: 33 packages with individual dependencies
4. **Network Timeouts**: Observed pip timeout issues (from bootstrap attempt)

### Build Performance Baseline

#### Estimated Current Performance
```
Environment Setup Time: ~2-3 minutes per job
Dependency Installation: ~3-5 minutes per job  
Test Execution: ~5-10 minutes (estimated)
Docker Builds: ~5-15 minutes per image
Total Pipeline Time: ~20-40 minutes (estimated)
```
**Note**: Actual metrics need measurement via workflow execution

#### Resource Utilization
```
GitHub Actions Minutes: High usage across 10 workflows
Concurrent Jobs: Multiple workflows may run simultaneously
Cache Usage: Limited dependency caching visible
Artifact Storage: Multiple artifact uploads per workflow
```
