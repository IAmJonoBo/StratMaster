## Why These Files Were Archived

The new documentation provides significant improvements:

- **Better Organization**: Diátaxis framework provides clear structure
- **Code-Synced Examples**: All examples derived from actual tests
- **Enhanced Content**: More comprehensive and up-to-date information
- **Improved Navigation**: Hierarchical structure with cross-references
- **Consistent Style**: Uniform formatting and presentation

## If You Need Legacy Content

These files are preserved for reference but should not be used as primary documentation. If you need information from these files:

1. Check the new documentation first - it likely has better information
2. Search for specific topics in the new structure
3. File an issue if important content is missing from the new docs

The new documentation is maintained and updated, while these legacy files are frozen in time.
