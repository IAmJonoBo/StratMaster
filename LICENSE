# License

Open Brand Strategy AI â€” License Placeholder

TODO[OPS-001]: Finalise repository license (MIT vs Apache-2.0 vs BSL-1.1) before wider collaboration. See `docs/backlog.md#ops-001-license-selection` for scope, acceptance criteria, and PR sequencing. Until resolved, all rights remain with the repository owner.

Note: Replacing this placeholder with the chosen OSI-approved license (or intentionally restricted licence) is required ahead of public contributions.
