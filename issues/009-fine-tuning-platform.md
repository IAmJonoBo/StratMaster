# Issue 009: Custom Model Fine-Tuning Platform

## Summary
Implement the enterprise fine-tuning platform defined in [Implementation Plan §Custom Model Fine-Tuning Platform](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#custom-model-fine-tuning-platform).

## Current State
- ML training code focuses on constitutional compliance; no dataset registry, orchestration, or adapter deployment path exists.【F:packages/ml-training/src/constitutional_trainer.py†L1-L404】

## Proposed Solution
1. Build dataset registry and secure storage workflow (ingestion, validation, lineage).
2. Orchestrate fine-tuning jobs (Ray/Kubeflow) and store artifacts in a model registry with evaluation metrics.
3. Integrate LiteLLM gateway with per-tenant adapters and add compliance approval workflow.

## Feature Flag
- `ENABLE_CUSTOM_FINE_TUNING` (default `false`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tenants can submit fine-tuning jobs via API; job lifecycle observable via dashboard.
- Model artifacts stored with metadata, evaluations, and access controls; adapters deployable through gateway when approved.
- Documentation details dataset handling, compliance, and rollback.
- With flag disabled, system continues to use vendor models without exposing fine-tune APIs.

## Dependencies
- Scalable compute resources (GPU nodes) and storage (MinIO/S3).
- Compliance review tooling and audit logging.

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for dataset validation and job config serialization.
- Integration tests executing lightweight fine-tune on synthetic data in CI or nightly pipeline.
- Contract tests for job submission/status APIs and adapter deployment flow.

## Rollout & Monitoring
- Pilot with internal datasets; expand to enterprise tenants after compliance sign-off.
- Monitor job success rates, resource utilization, and adapter inference metrics.
