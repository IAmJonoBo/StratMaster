# Issue 001: Real-Time Collaboration Engine

## Summary
Implement the real-time collaboration service described in [Implementation Plan §Real-Time Collaboration](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#real-time-collaboration-engine) to deliver the Week 4 roadmap objective.

## Current State
- `packages/collaboration/` only provides documentation; there is no running service or client integration.【F:packages/collaboration/README.md†L1-L42】
- Web workspace panes render static content without CRDT bindings.

## Proposed Solution
1. Scaffold a FastAPI WebSocket service with Yjs-based CRDT support and persistence.
2. Wire the web client behind the `ENABLE_COLLAB_LIVE` feature flag.
3. Add audit logging, observability, and rollout tooling as outlined in the implementation plan.

## Feature Flag
- `ENABLE_COLLAB_LIVE` (default `false`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Collaboration service container runs locally and in CI with health checks.
- Web clients joined to the same session see <150 ms update propagation under LAN test conditions.
- Comprehensive unit, contract, and E2E tests exist and pass with the feature flag enabled; default pipelines continue to pass with the flag disabled.
- Documentation updates published for API reference, tutorials, and operations guides.

## Dependencies
- Redis/Postgres availability for session state.
- Keycloak tokens for WebSocket authentication.

## Testing Plan
- Run unit tests for session repository and CRDT merge logic.
- Execute Playwright/Browser-driven co-editing scenarios.
- Include load test validating concurrent participants.

## Rollout & Monitoring
- Stage rollout (dev → staging shadow → pilot).
- Add Prometheus dashboards for session counts and latency.
