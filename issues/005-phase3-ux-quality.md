# Issue 005: Phase 3 UX Quality Gates

## Summary
Close the remaining Phase 3 UX deliverables described in [Implementation Plan §Phase 3 UX Quality Gates](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#phase-3-ux-quality-gates).

## Current State
- WCAG 2.1 AA validation, responsive testing, and Lighthouse performance budgets are outstanding in the roadmap checklist.【F:Upgrade.md†L575-L588】
- Accessibility tooling exists only as a placeholder script without CI coverage.

## Proposed Solution
1. Expand accessibility audit tooling (axe, keyboard navigation) and integrate into CI.
2. Add Playwright responsiveness tests and document mobile testing matrix.
3. Configure Lighthouse CI with score thresholds >90 and remediate issues.

## Feature Flags
- `ENABLE_LIGHTHOUSE_CI` (controls expensive checks).
- Component-level flags as needed for remediation rollouts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated accessibility suite passes with zero critical violations across key pages.
- Responsive tests cover defined breakpoints and device profiles.
- Lighthouse CI job runs in PR (optional) and nightly pipelines, enforcing score budgets.
- Documentation includes accessibility guide, responsive testing checklist, and updated mobile roadmap.

## Dependencies
- Browser automation infrastructure (Playwright, headless Chrome).
- Potential BrowserStack/Sauce Labs accounts for device coverage.

## Testing Plan
- Component unit tests verifying ARIA roles and keyboard support.
- Playwright scenarios for viewport-specific regressions.
- Lighthouse CI runs capturing performance metrics.

## Rollout & Monitoring
- Introduce tooling behind flags to avoid blocking contributors, then progressively enforce.
- Track accessibility and performance metrics via dashboards.
