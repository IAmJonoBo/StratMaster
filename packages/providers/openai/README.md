# Providers: OpenAI (optional)

This package hosts optional OpenAI provider shims and client tooling.

- Provider mode (router): optional routing to OpenAI endpoints per tenant policy.
- Client mode (tools): expose JSON Schema tools compatible with OpenAI Responses API.

See `configs/router/models-policy.yaml` for per-tenant toggles and limits.
