# MCP Servers (placeholders)

Planned servers per blueprint:

- research-mcp: metasearch and crawl tools
- knowledge-mcp: hybrid retrieval, GraphRAG, ColBERT/SPLADE tools
- evals-mcp: evaluation suites
- router-mcp: model routing (vLLM/Ollama/OpenAI)
- compression-mcp: LLMLingua-based prompt compression

Each server will be packaged under this folder with its own README and tests.
