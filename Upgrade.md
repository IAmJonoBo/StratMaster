  - **Impact**: Strategy document parsing fully operational

#### üöÄ CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (4 Weeks to Frontier-Ready)

Based on detailed technical analysis from Scratch.md, the following concrete implementations are prioritized:

##### Week 1: Platform Glue (P0 - Critical)

**1. OSS-First Model Gateway Implementation**
- **Deploy LiteLLM Proxy** as OpenAI-compatible gateway with auth, rate-limits, budgets
- **Local High-Throughput Backends**:
  - vLLM for text/vision chat and embeddings (paged attention, batching) 
  - Hugging Face TGI for GPU-efficient generation and re-ranking
- **Cloud Fallbacks**: Together AI + HF Inference Endpoints via LiteLLM adapters
- **Per-tenant model allowlists** via configuration management
- **Quality Gate**: p50 gateway overhead < 5ms, no single provider outage affects >20% traffic

**2. Enterprise Observability Complete**
- **OpenTelemetry FastAPI instrumentation** with OTLP collector export
- **Langfuse integration** for LLM traces (inputs/outputs, tokens, latency, cost)  
- **RAGAS metrics** in CI to catch retrieval/reasoning regressions
- **Quality Gate**: 100% LLM calls traced, per-tenant cost dashboards operational

**3. Export Backend Implementation**
- **Notion API**: Pages & blocks (append children), databases for briefs
- **Trello API**: Create/update cards, lists, labels with OAuth
- **Jira Cloud API**: Issues (create/search via JQL), transitions, links
- **Quality Gate**: Idempotent exports (re-runs update, don't duplicate)

##### Week 2: Evaluation & Routing (P0 - Critical)

**4. Evidence-Guided Model Recommender**
- **External Signals**: LMSYS Arena (chat), MTEB (embeddings) integration
- **Internal Evals**: Langfuse experiments + RAGAS on StratMaster tasks
- **Cascade Routing**: Two-stage (cheap ‚Üí strong) per FrugalGPT/RouteLLM approach
- **Nightly Scoring**: Utility = quality_z - Œª¬∑cost - Œº¬∑latency optimization
- **Quality Gate**: Routing decision time p50 < 20ms, provenance tracking operational

##### Week 3: Retrieval Uplift (P0 - Critical)

**5. SPLADE-v3 Integration**
- **Sparse Lexical Expansion** for OOD recall and robustness improvement
- **OpenSearch Integration**: Index SPLADE vectors in inverted index
- **Hybrid Fusion**: RRF or weighted sum with BM25 + dense scores
- **Quality Gate**: +‚â•10% NDCG@10 vs BM25+dense alone, <15% latency hit at p95

##### Week 4: Collaboration & Compliance (P1 - Important)

**6. Real-Time Collaboration**  
- **Yjs Integration** with y-websocket provider for CRDT-based editing
- **Presence System**: Cursors, editing awareness, conflict-free merges
- **Storage**: Updates in Postgres/Redis via y-redis adapter
- **Quality Gate**: <150ms echo latency on LAN, multi-tab torture test passes

**7. OIDC Integration Completion**
- **Keycloak Configuration**: "public" and "confidential" client with Auth Code + PKCE
- **Role Mapping**: StratMaster RBAC integration with session introspection
- **Quality Gate**: Login ‚Üí token ‚Üí API call ‚Üí audit log round-trip in OTel traces

#### Performance & Quality Gates (Go/No-Go Criteria)

**Concrete Measurable Targets:**
- ‚úÖ Gateway overhead: p50 < 5ms, p95 < 15ms (LiteLLM proxy)
- ‚úÖ Routing decision time: p50 < 20ms (metadata-only policy + cached model table)
- ‚úÖ RAG metrics: RAGAS faithfulness ‚â• 0.8, context precision/recall ‚â• 0.7
- ‚úÖ Retrieval improvement: +‚â•10% NDCG@10 vs current baseline after SPLADE-v3
- ‚úÖ Observability: 100% LLM calls traced in Langfuse with cost dashboards  
- ‚úÖ Export idempotency: Brown-field re-runs update existing, don't duplicate
- ‚úÖ Security: OIDC auth flows pass, roles enforced in API, audit events captured

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Technical Risks:**
- **Provider drift/outages**: LiteLLM fallback order + health checks, local vLLM/TGI mirrors
- **Benchmark mismatch**: Combine public leaderboards with internal evals (internal wins ties)
- **Retrieval regressions**: RAGAS in CI with thresholds, feature flag rollbacks

**Implementation Risks:**
- **Complexity overload**: Focus on proven OSS tools (LiteLLM, vLLM, Yjs, RAGAS)
- **Performance claims**: Separate proxy overhead, route-decision time, model time reporting
- **Integration challenges**: Start with minimal viable implementations, iterate based on feedback

### Network Environment Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Environment Constraints**:
- **pip timeouts** are common in restricted network environments
- **Docker image access** may be limited
- **Pre-commit hooks** may fail due to network dependencies
- **Alternative**: Use CI/CD environments for full dependency testing

### Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Deploy with Current State** (95% functional)
2. **Resolve dependencies** in production environment
3. **Complete OIDC integration** for enterprise readiness
4. **Defer desktop packaging** until web platform is established
