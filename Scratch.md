Summary

You want StratMaster upgraded to a frontier-grade, OSS-first AI platform with rigorous quality gates and an intelligent model-routing/recommendation layer. Below is a concrete, phased implementation plan that leverages your current stack while adding high-leverage components (vLLM/TGI, Langfuse+OTel, LiteLLM gateway, Frugal/Route-style routing, RAG evaluation) and clean CI/CD guardrails. Where possible I cite primary docs and live leaderboards so the system can “explain its choices”.

Auto-Expert setup (concise)

Task type: Architecture & delivery strategy.
Personas & methods:
	•	AI Platform Architect: reference designs; latency/cost/reliability budgeting; provider abstraction (LiteLLM/vLLM).
	•	IR/RAG Scientist: retrieval design, hybrid search, graph-augmented RAG; eval via BEIR/MTEB, RAGAS/TruLens.
	•	MLOps/SRE: CI/CD, SBOM, policy-as-code, telemetry (OTel/Prometheus/Loki), SLIs/SLOs.
Pre-registered plan: audit → baseline → route+recommend → harden → scale. Evidence gates: ≥2 primary sources per key claim; frontier tools only.

A. Architecture you can stand up now (OSS-first)

Inference & provider abstraction
	•	vLLM for high-throughput local serving (OpenAI-compatible server) for open-weights models; pair with TGI when you want HF’s Rust/gRPC stack and LoRA-merge workflows.  ￼
	•	LiteLLM Proxy as the single OpenAI-compatible gateway across local vLLM/TGI, Together AI, HF Inference Providers, etc. (unified auth, cost tracking, fallbacks).  ￼
	•	Model sources/benchmarks: dynamically reference LMSYS Chatbot Arena (pairwise Elo across millions of human votes) and Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard (H4) to seed priors for quality; use MTEB for embeddings.  ￼

Retrieval & storage
	•	Hybrid RAG: BM25 (OpenSearch) + dense (Qdrant) + optional GraphRAG (entity/relation memory via NebulaGraph) for complex, multi-hop queries.  ￼
	•	Object storage: MinIO for S3-compatible document blobs, model artifacts and logs.  ￼

Observability & evaluation
	•	Langfuse for tracing/evals; OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for FastAPI/requests; Prometheus + Grafana + Loki for SLIs (p50/p95 latency, TTFB, tokens/s, errors).  ￼
	•	Quality eval: lm-evaluation-harness for general LLMs; RAGAS and TruLens for RAG faithfulness/groundedness.  ￼

Policy & guardrails
	•	Microsoft Presidio for PII detection/redaction; Guardrails-AI for I/O validation and structured outputs (with OTel telemetry).  ￼

Note on current repo context: StratMaster already lists many of these components (Qdrant, OpenSearch, NebulaGraph, MinIO, vLLM, Temporal, Langfuse, Keycloak, SearxNG). The plan below assumes continuity with that direction.  ￼

B. Intelligent model recommendation & routing (frontier-grade)

Design goal: choose “the right model, first time” given task, constraints, and live telemetry.
	1.	Signal layer
	•	Inputs: task taxonomy (chat, code, extraction, RAG-answer), budget cap, latency SLO, privacy level; live metrics (avg/percentile latency, error rate, tokens/s, current provider limits), and leaderboard priors from LM Arena/H4 + local micro-bench scores.  ￼
	2.	Policy layer (router)
	•	Start simple with a cascade (cheap → strong → strongest). Then add learned routing using FrugalGPT/RouteLLM-style policies that predict quality vs. cost/latency and select a single model when confident. Keep a rule-based override for compliance/PII.  ￼
	3.	Execution layer
	•	Implement via LiteLLM Proxy model groups and cost caps; backends: local vLLM for open weights (e.g., Llama-family, Mixtral, Qwen-2.5/3) and remote providers (Together AI, HF Inference Providers) for burst or specialised tasks.  ￼
	4.	Continuous calibration
	•	Nightly micro-bench: route a stratified sample of your real prompts to a panel of candidate models; update a Bayesian utility score per task × model (uses Arena/H4 as prior, your evals as likelihood). Store in a model registry table used by the router.

C. Phased delivery plan with quality gates

Phase 0 — Baseline & hardening (2–3 sprints)
	•	Stand up LiteLLM Proxy in front of vLLM/TGI and one remote provider.
	•	Add Langfuse + OTel tracing, Prometheus/Loki metrics, and PII scrubbing with Presidio before persistence.
	•	CI gates in GitHub Actions: unit+e2e (pytest), type-check, fmt/lint, SBOM via Syft + vuln scan via OSV-Scanner/Grype/Trivy, SLSA provenance on container builds. Targets: tests ≥ 85% critical paths; zero high vulns; p95 latency budget set per route.  ￼

Phase 1 — RAG excellence (2–4 sprints)
	•	Hybrid retrievers (OpenSearch BM25 + Qdrant dense); add GraphRAG path for multi-hop questions; store chunk→entity provenance.
	•	Eval gates: RAGAS faithfulness ≥ 0.75; answer similarity ≥ 0.80 (task-dependent); hallucination < 2%.  ￼

Phase 2 — Routing & recommendations (2–4 sprints)
	•	Implement cascade → learned router (Frugal/Route patterns). Budget-aware policies: “cost ceiling”, “latency ceiling”, “privacy required”.
	•	Gate: router beats static best-single-model by ≥5% utility at ≤80% cost on your micro-bench.  ￼

Phase 3 — Production polish (ongoing)
	•	Add Temporal for long-running workflows; Keycloak for SSO; SearxNG for web research; capacity tests; canary deploys; autoscaling vLLM/TGI. (Aligns with repo direction.)

D. Concrete configs (starter skeletons)

liteLLM proxy (model groups & caps)

# litellm_config.yaml
general_settings:
  telemetry: true
model_list:
  - model_name: open-llm.local.high_throughput
    litellm_params: { model: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct", api_base: "http://vllm:8000/v1" }
  - model_name: together.qwen72b
    litellm_params: { model: "qwen/qwen2.5-72b-instruct", api_base: "https://api.together.xyz/v1" }
routing:
  budget_usd_per_req: 0.05
  latency_ms_p95: 1500
  privacy: "allow_open"   # or "require_open_weights_local"

OTel + Langfuse (Python)

from langfuse.openai import openai
openai.api_key = "env"
openai.base_url = "http://litellm:4000"  # proxy
# Langfuse keys via env; OTel autoinstrument fastapi/requests

(See docs for vLLM OpenAI-compatible server, Langfuse OpenAI wrappers, and OTel FastAPI/requests instrumentation.)  ￼

E. SLIs/SLOs & “quality gates” to enforce in CI/CD
	•	Latency: p95 < 1.5s for simple prompts; < 3s for RAG answers.
	•	Stability: error rate < 0.5%; no provider 5xx bursts > 2 min.
	•	RAG quality: faithfulness ≥ 0.75; grounded citations ≥ 0.9 coverage.
	•	Security: 0 high CVEs; SBOM generated per build; SLSA provenance attached.  ￼

⸻

Risks & unknowns
	•	GitHub web rendering blocked me from reading Upgrade.md directly; I proceeded from the root README and your stated direction. Paste key “open items” if you want me to thread them into this plan immediately.  ￼
	•	Vendor-benchmark drift is constant; that’s why the router leans on live micro-bench + Arena/H4 priors rather than static picks.  ￼

Provenance (strong-rec block)

Data: Official docs for vLLM/TGI, LiteLLM, Qdrant/OpenSearch/NebulaGraph/MinIO; Langfuse/OTel/Prometheus/Loki; Presidio/Guardrails; LM Arena & H4 leaderboards; FrugalGPT/RouteLLM routing research; StratMaster repo overview.
Methods: Lateral reading; prefer primary documentation and peer-review/preprint sources for routing; avoid vendor claims for speed unless corroborated.
Key results: OpenAI-compatible local serving (vLLM/TGI) + LiteLLM gives unified API; hybrid RAG + GraphRAG improves complex Q/A; Langfuse+OTel enables measurable SLIs; Frugal/Route-style policies justify dynamic routing; leaderboards supply priors while nightly micro-bench supplies local evidence.  ￼
Uncertainty: Leaderboards are imperfect proxies; provider SLAs/quotas shift; eval metrics can mis-rank models without task-matched datasets.
Safer alternative: Freeze a vetted “golden trio” (e.g., local Llama-3 70B, Mixtral 8×7B, remote Qwen-2.5 72B) behind manual switches, then graduate to learned routing.  ￼
