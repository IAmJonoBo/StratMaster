Here’s a tight, end-to-end implementation strategy that finishes the remaining items, locks in OSS-first foundations, and adds a smart model-selection layer that continuously routes to the best-value models across Hugging Face, Together, vLLM, and more—using real benchmarks and live telemetry.

Executive summary (what to implement)
	1.	Finish enterprise hardening (P0): complete OIDC (Keycloak), ship export backends (Notion/Trello/Jira), stand up observability with Langfuse + OpenTelemetry, and run formal perf + RAG evaluation gates.  ￼
	2.	OSS-first model gateway (P0): front everything with LiteLLM Proxy and vLLM/TGI backends; add TogetherAI and HF Inference Endpoints as cloud fallbacks. This gives one OpenAI-compatible API with cost/latency logging, routing/fallbacks, and live model lists.  ￼
	3.	Evidence-guided model recommender (P0): use LMSYS Arena (general chat), MTEB (embeddings), and internal evals (Langfuse + RAGAS) to auto-rank models for each task/tenant; apply cascade/routing ideas (FrugalGPT/RouteLLM) to minimise spend at equal quality.  ￼
	4.	Retrieval stack validation (P0): keep hybrid BM25 + vectors; add SPLADE-v3 sparse encoder for resilient lexical recall; document MRR@10/NDCG@10 targets and test plan.  ￼
	5.	Collaboration (P1): real-time co-editing via Yjs (WebSocket provider), with OT/CRDT conflict-free sync and presence.  ￼

Below I lay out exactly how to implement, the quality gates, and the model-selection engine.

⸻

1) Enterprise hardening (finish & prove)

OIDC (Keycloak)
	•	Configure a “public” and “confidential” client (Auth Code + PKCE), map roles → StratMaster RBAC, and enable session introspection on the API gateway.  ￼
Quality gate: login → token → API call → audit log round-trip captured in OTel traces and Langfuse spans.

Observability & evaluation
	•	OpenTelemetry auto-instrument FastAPI; export to OTLP collector. Use Langfuse for LLM traces (inputs/outputs, token counts, latency, cost), experiments, and evals.  ￼
	•	Add RAGAS metrics (context precision/recall, faithfulness) to CI to catch regressions in retrieval/reasoning.  ￼
Quality gate: dashboards show p50/p95 latency, tokens, cost per request, pass/fail on eval sets.

Export backends
	•	Implement serverside Notion/Trello/Jira exporters with OAuth and webhooks; keep the existing UI. Start with:
	•	Notion: pages & blocks (append children); databases for briefs.  ￼
	•	Trello: create/update cards, lists, labels.  ￼
	•	Jira Cloud: issues (create/search via JQL), transitions, links.  ￼
Quality gate: dry-run preview matches final object; idempotent updates (re-runs don’t duplicate).

2) Model serving & routing (OSS-first, cloud-smart)

Gateway pattern
	•	Deploy LiteLLM Proxy as the single OpenAI-compatible ingress (auth, rate-limits, budgets, request mirroring, provider fallbacks). Keep per-tenant model allowlists via config.  ￼
	•	Attach local high-throughput backends:
	•	vLLM for text/vision chat and embeddings (paged attention, batching, OpenAI-compatible server).  ￼
	•	Hugging Face TGI for GPU-efficient generation and re-ranking (SSE streaming, metrics, guidance/JSON tooling).  ￼
	•	Add cloud fallbacks/providers: Together AI (broad curated models) and HF Inference Endpoints (managed autoscaling + BYOM). Use LiteLLM provider adapters.  ￼

Minimal config sketch (conceptual):

# litellm proxy
model_list:
  - model_name: chat-default        # alias used by StratMaster
    litellm_params: { model: openai/llama-3.1-8b-instruct, api_base: http://vllm:8000/v1 }
  - model_name: chat-premium
    litellm_params: { model: huggingface/tgi/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, api_base: http://tgi:8080 }
  - model_name: embed-default
    litellm_params: { model: text-embedding-3-large, api_base: http://vllm:8000/v1 }
  - model_name: cloud-fallback
    litellm_params: { model: together_ai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-Turbo }
routing:
  rules:
    - when: {task: "embed"} use: embed-default
    - when: {tenant: "regulated"} prefer: chat-premium fallback: cloud-fallback
    - when: {cost_surge: true} prefer: chat-default

Quality gates
	•	p50 end-to-end gateway overhead < 5 ms; no single provider outage affects >20% traffic thanks to fallbacks. (Model compute latency is separate.)  ￼

3) AI-assisted Model Recommendation Engine

Signals we combine
	•	External leaderboards: LMSYS Arena for chat-general performance; MTEB for embeddings.  ￼
	•	Internal evals: Langfuse experiments + RAGAS on StratMaster tasks; cost & latency telemetry from gateway; user feedback (HITL accept/escalate).  ￼

Routing policy (learned + rules)
	•	Start with a two-stage cascade (cheap → strong) per FrugalGPT/RouteLLM: try a small/quantised local model; escalate to a larger model on low confidence or policy triggers (safety, critical brief). (We implement the idea, not the exact paper code.)
	•	Confidence comes from: retrieval coverage (RAGAS context recall), self-consistency (vote among 2–3 cheap models), and task heuristics (doc length, tool-use required).  ￼

Ranking & selection loop
	•	Nightly job recomputes a scorecard per model: utility = quality_z - λ·cost - μ·latency, using latest internal evals, then updates LiteLLM config and feature flags.
	•	Human override: per-tenant allow/deny and preferred families (e.g., “open-weights only”).
	•	Display provenance: which models were tried, costs, and why we escalated (Langfuse spans).

Why this is credible
	•	LiteLLM already supports multi-provider routing/fallbacks and cost tracking. vLLM/TGI give us on-prem throughput and OpenAI-compatibility. Langfuse+RAGAS give continuous, dataset-level evidence.  ￼

4) Retrieval & reasoning performance (prove it)

Hybrid retrieval
	•	Keep BM25 + vectors and add SPLADE-v3 (sparse lexical expansion) to improve OOD recall and robustness; index SPLADE vectors in OpenSearch’s inverted index and fuse with dense scores (RRF or weighted sum).  ￼
Benchmarks
	•	Report NDCG@10/MRR@10 on BEIR-like splits; log per-query contribution to downstream task accuracy (brief correctness).
	•	Accept if: +≥10% NDCG@10 vs BM25+dense alone, no >15% latency hit at p95.

⸻

5) Real-time collaboration (deliver quickly, safely)
	•	Use Yjs with y-websocket provider; store updates in Postgres or Redis via y-redis; add awareness (cursors, presence). Proven CRDT engine with editor bindings (TipTap/ProseMirror/CodeMirror).  ￼
	•	Quality gates: <150 ms echo latency on LAN; conflict-free merges in multi-tab torture tests.

⸻

6) Concrete performance & quality gates (go/no-go)
	•	Gateway overhead: p50 < 5 ms, p95 < 15 ms (LiteLLM proxy).  ￼
	•	Routing decision time: p50 < 20 ms (metadata-only policy + cached model table).
	•	RAG metrics: RAGAS faithfulness ≥ 0.8 on internal set; context precision/recall ≥ 0.7.  ￼
	•	Retrieval: +≥10% NDCG@10 vs current baseline after SPLADE-v3 fusion.  ￼
	•	Observability: 100% of LLM calls traced in Langfuse; per-tenant cost dashboards.  ￼
	•	Exports: brown-field idempotency (re-runs update, not duplicate).
	•	Security: OIDC auth flows pass; roles enforced in API; audit events captured end-to-end.  ￼

7) Implementation plan (4 weeks to “frontier-ready”)

Week 1 – Platform glue (P0)
	•	Deploy LiteLLM Proxy + vLLM/TGI; wire OpenAI-compatible base URLs in StratMaster. Enable spend tracking & per-tenant keys.  ￼
	•	Add OTel FastAPI instrumentation; deploy Langfuse (self-host or cloud). Start logging all LLM calls.  ￼
	•	Ship Notion/Trello/Jira minimal exporters (create/update); gate behind feature flags.  ￼

Week 2 – Evaluation & routing (P0)
	•	Build RAGAS CI job with golden data; integrate Langfuse Experiments for offline A/B on prompts/models.  ￼
	•	Implement routing policy module (cheap→strong cascade + rules) and feedback capture (HITL accept/escalate tags feed learning).

Week 3 – Retrieval uplift (P0)
	•	Train/plug SPLADE-v3 encoder; index in OpenSearch (sparse) and fuse with dense/Qdrant where applicable; run BEIR-style suite and ship report.  ￼

Week 4 – Collaboration & compliance (P1)
	•	Add Yjs collab for tri-pane editor (presence, cursors, undo/redo); run load test.  ￼
	•	Complete OIDC edge cases; finalize audit dashboards.

8) Notes on the “<20 ms” claim

It’s reasonable for a router decision (metadata + cache) to be <20 ms at p50. It is not a sensible target for end-to-end LLM responses (token generation dominates). We’ll publish: (a) proxy overhead, (b) route-decision time, and (c) model time separately to avoid metric theatre.

⸻

9) Risks & mitigations
	•	Provider drift / outages: use LiteLLM fallback order and health checks; mirror critical prompts/models locally via vLLM/TGI.  ￼
	•	Benchmark mismatch: combine public leaderboards (LMSYS/MTEB) with our task evals; internal evals win ties.  ￼
	•	Retrieval regressions: RAGAS in CI with thresholds; rollbacks via feature flags.  ￼

Evidence-Gated Protocol (for the strong recs)

Data → Official docs for LiteLLM Proxy (OpenAI-compatible multi-provider gateway), vLLM OpenAI server, HF TGI/Inference Endpoints, OTel FastAPI, Langfuse observability/evals, RAGAS metrics, Yjs CRDT, SPLADE-v3 sparse retrieval, and Notion/Trello/Jira APIs.  ￼
Methods → OSS gateway with model fallbacks; nightly scorecards from Langfuse+RAGAS; retrieval fusion with SPLADE; CRDT-based collaboration; OIDC on Keycloak.
Key results → One API for all models/providers; observable cost/latency; automatic routing that optimises for utility; measured retrieval uplift; real-time co-editing.
Uncertainty → Public leaderboards aren’t identical to your use-cases; SPLADE gains vary by corpus; Together/HF endpoint pricing/limits change.
Safer alternative → If you want lowest implementation risk now, ship gateway + observability + minimal exporters and postpone SPLADE/collab until after the first enterprise pilot.

Where to extend next (after 4 weeks)
	•	Add re-rankers in vLLM/TGI (Cohere-compatible rerank API in vLLM) for long-doc accuracy.  ￼
	•	Integrate arena-style side-by-side human evals for strategy briefs (small internal “Arena”).  ￼
	•	Optional: evented pipelines with a workflow engine (Temporal) for heavy jobs; keep core API sync for UX.
	•	Desktop (Tauri) can remain low priority until web usage hardens.
