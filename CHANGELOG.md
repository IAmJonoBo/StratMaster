## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 15, 2024

**What's New**:

🚀 **Multi-Agent Debate System**: Revolutionary AI collaboration where specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Critic, Evidence, Synthesis) work together to produce high-quality, evidence-based strategic insights through structured argumentation.

🏗️ **Enterprise-Ready Architecture**: Built on microservices architecture using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for optimal scalability and maintainability. Supports horizontal scaling from single-node development to multi-region production deployments.

🔒 **Zero-Trust Security**: Comprehensive security model with end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, audit logging, and compliance framework supporting GDPR, SOC 2, and ISO 27001.

📊 **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time performance monitoring, quality gates validation, and comprehensive observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry integration.

🌐 **Multi-Tenant SaaS Ready**: Native multi-tenancy with strict data isolation, custom domains, and tenant-specific configurations for enterprise deployments.

**Technical Highlights**:

- **Performance**: Sub-second API response times with 99.9% uptime SLA
