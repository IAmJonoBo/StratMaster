- **Observability**: Metrics, logs, and traces updated when modules/services change; runbooks reference dashboards.

## Risk & Mitigation Matrix
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Dependency upgrades cause breaking changes | High | Medium | Canary releases, feature flags, blue/green environments, rollback plan per sprint. |
| Test coverage goals delay timeline | Medium | Medium | Prioritize high-value modules, automate test scaffolding, allocate QA pairing time. |
| CI/CD pipeline instability during refactor | High | Medium | Progressive rollout, shadow pipelines, rollback toggle, infrastructure as code versioning. |
| Team adoption resistance | Medium | Medium | Conduct workshops, provide migration guides, gather feedback via office hours. |
| Tooling/license constraints | Medium | Low | Validate licensing early, involve procurement, consider open-source alternatives. |

## Reporting & Metrics
- **Weekly**: Burn-up charts, sprint status, risk register updates.
- **Per Sprint Review**: Demo of deliverables, quality gate results, dependency updates, coverage metrics, pipeline performance.
- **Post-Program**: ROI analysis, maintenance plan, roadmap for further optimization.

## Exit Criteria
- Modular architecture fully documented and adopted by core services.
- Automated pipelines enforce quality gates with zero outstanding critical issues.
- Test coverage and performance SLAs met or exceeded.
- Virtual environment provisioning automated, repeatable, and documented.
- Operational runbooks delivered to support teams with training completed.
