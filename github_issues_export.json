Extend knowledge package with graph analytics (PageRank, community detection) and NebulaGraph integrations.\n2. Integrate causal inference libraries (DoWhy/EconML) to compute causal scores stored alongside graph edges.\n3. Expose reasoning APIs and UI overlays behind `ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_REASONING`.\n\n## Feature Flag\n- `ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_REASONING` (default `false`).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Graph analytics outputs persisted with metadata and surfaced via API.\n- Causal reasoning endpoints return narratives with supporting evidence; strategy engine can consume causal weights.\n- UI visualises causal graph overlays when flag enabled.\n- Documentation covers algorithms, interpretation guidance, and privacy considerations.\n\n## Dependencies\n- NebulaGraph cluster access and analytics libraries (networkx, dowhy).\n- Strategy engine integration for consuming causal insights.\n\n## Testing Plan\n- Unit tests for analytics algorithms using deterministic synthetic graphs.\n- Contract tests for reasoning API schema and latency budgets.\n- Integration tests ensuring strategy recommendations incorporate causal adjustments without regression.\n\n## Rollout & Monitoring\n- Start with analytics-only reports, then enable UI overlays.\n- Monitor computation latency, cache hit rates, and user adoption metrics.\n\n\n---\n\n## How to Create This Issue\n\n1.
