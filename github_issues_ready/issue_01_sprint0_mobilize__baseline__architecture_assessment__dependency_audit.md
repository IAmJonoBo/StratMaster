# [SPRINT-0] Mobilize & Baseline - Architecture Assessment & Dependency Audit

**Labels:** enhancement, SM_REFACTOR_STRAT, implementation
**Priority:** P0 (for Sprint 0 and first 3 issues), P1 (for others)
**Milestone:** SM_REFACTOR_STRAT Modernization Program

---

## Epic Overview
Implement Sprint 0 of the SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md program: Mobilize & Baseline activities (Weeks 1-3) to capture current architecture, define modularization strategy, and establish tooling baselines.

## Sprint 0 Objectives  
- Capture current architecture, runtime, and dependency graph
- Define modularization strategy and target operating model
- Establish tooling baselines for testing and virtual environment setup

## Issues / Epics from SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md
1. `ARCH-001` Architecture Assessment & Domain Mapping
2. `DEP-001` Dependency Inventory & Risk Classification  
3. `QA-001` Test Coverage Benchmarking & Test Data Audit
4. `OPS-001` CI/CD & Virtual Environment Baseline Analysis

## Key Activities Checklist
- [ ] **Architecture Discovery**: Run automated architecture discovery scripts; document data flow diagrams
- [ ] **Dependency Analysis**: Classify dependencies by criticality, EOL status, and upgrade path
- [ ] **Test Analysis**: Analyze test suites for coverage, flakiness, and runtime
- [ ] **Environment Baseline**: Measure setup time for current virtual environments and Docker images

## Quality Gates
- [ ] **ADR Creation**: Architecture decision records (ADR) for module boundaries drafted
- [ ] **Security Review**: Dependency risk matrix approved by security
- [ ] **Coverage Baseline**: Baseline coverage report validated (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [ ] **DevOps Audit**: CI/CD audit report reviewed by DevOps guild

## Deliverables
- [ ] **Baseline Architecture Workbook**: Complete current state documentation + ADR backlog
- [ ] **Dependency Audit Report**: Upgrade priority backlog with risk assessment
- [ ] **Test Coverage Heatmap**: Coverage metrics + data quality findings
- [ ] **CI/CD Benchmark Report**: Environment setup performance baseline

## Implementation Tasks

### ARCH-001: Architecture Assessment & Domain Mapping
- [ ] Document current module boundaries and dependencies
- [ ] Create data flow diagrams for key user journeys
- [ ] Identify modularization opportunities and anti-patterns
- [ ] Draft ADRs for proposed module boundaries

### DEP-001: Dependency Inventory & Risk Classification
- [ ] Catalog all 29 packages and their dependency trees
- [ ] Classify dependencies by criticality (core, optional, dev)
- [ ] Identify EOL packages and security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Create upgrade priority matrix

### QA-001: Test Coverage Benchmarking & Test Data Audit  
- [ ] Generate comprehensive test coverage report
- [ ] Analyze test execution times and identify flaky tests
- [ ] Audit test data quality and maintainability
- [ ] Document testing gaps and improvement opportunities

### OPS-001: CI/CD & Virtual Environment Baseline Analysis
- [ ] Measure current CI/CD pipeline performance
- [ ] Benchmark virtual environment setup times
- [ ] Document Docker image sizes and build times
- [ ] Identify optimization opportunities

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of current architecture documented
- Clear modularization strategy defined with stakeholder buy-in
- Baseline metrics established for all quality improvements
- Foundation ready for Sprint 1 implementation work

## Timeline
**Duration:** 3 weeks (Sprint 0)
**Dependencies:** None - this is the foundation sprint
**Blocks:** All subsequent sprints depend on baseline completion

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Architecture docs**: Current state diagrams and proposed future state
- [ ] **Development guides**: Updated setup and testing procedures
- [ ] **Decision records**: ADRs for major architectural decisions

## Quality Metrics Targets (from SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md)
- 30% reduction in build pipeline duration
- 90% automated test coverage on core modules
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 40% reduction in onboarding time

## Related Work
- Follows SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md Sprint 0 definition
- Enables subsequent Sprint 1-4 implementation work
- Establishes quality gates for modernization targets
