# Issue 010: Advanced Knowledge Graph Reasoning

## Summary
Implement the knowledge reasoning enhancements in [Implementation Plan §Advanced Knowledge Graph Reasoning](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#advanced-knowledge-graph-reasoning).

## Current State
- Knowledge pipeline performs ingestion and hybrid search but lacks causal inference and advanced analytics.【F:packages/knowledge/src/knowledge/pipeline.py†L1-L100】

## Proposed Solution
1. Extend knowledge package with graph analytics (PageRank, community detection) and NebulaGraph integrations.
2. Integrate causal inference libraries (DoWhy/EconML) to compute causal scores stored alongside graph edges.
3. Expose reasoning APIs and UI overlays behind `ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_REASONING`.

## Feature Flag
- `ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_REASONING` (default `false`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Graph analytics outputs persisted with metadata and surfaced via API.
- Causal reasoning endpoints return narratives with supporting evidence; strategy engine can consume causal weights.
- UI visualises causal graph overlays when flag enabled.
- Documentation covers algorithms, interpretation guidance, and privacy considerations.

## Dependencies
- NebulaGraph cluster access and analytics libraries (networkx, dowhy).
- Strategy engine integration for consuming causal insights.

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for analytics algorithms using deterministic synthetic graphs.
- Contract tests for reasoning API schema and latency budgets.
- Integration tests ensuring strategy recommendations incorporate causal adjustments without regression.

## Rollout & Monitoring
- Start with analytics-only reports, then enable UI overlays.
- Monitor computation latency, cache hit rates, and user adoption metrics.
