## Manual Creation Instructions

1. **Individual Issues**: Each issue file in this directory contains:
   - Ready-to-copy title and body
   - Suggested labels and priority
   - Step-by-step creation instructions

2. **Batch Creation**: 
   - Start with Sprint 0 issue (foundation for all other work)
   - Create P0-critical issues next (001-003) 
   - Create remaining issues based on sprint schedule

3. **Labels to Apply**:
   - `enhancement` - for all implementation issues
   - `SM_REFACTOR_STRAT` - to track the modernization program
   - `implementation` - to distinguish from bugs/features
   - `P0-critical` - for Sprint 0 and issues 001-003
   - `sprint-0`, `sprint-1`, etc. - for sprint tracking

## Sprint Schedule (from SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md)

- **Sprint 0 (Weeks 1-3)**: Mobilize & Baseline
- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 4-6)**: Modular Architecture Foundations  
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 7-9)**: Dependency Modernization & Compatibility
- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 10-12)**: Testing & Quality Expansion
- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 13-15)**: CI/CD Evolution & Environment Optimization

## Success Metrics

The SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md program targets:
- 30% reduction in build pipeline duration
- 90% automated test coverage on core modules
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities  
- 40% reduction in onboarding time

Created: 11 issues ready for GitHub creation
