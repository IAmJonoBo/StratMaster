@workspace — Frontier Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan
Goal: Assess StratMaster against frontier standards and produce a concrete, staged implementation plan that gets us to “release-ready” with top-tier developer and user experience.

Scope & method
	1.	Build a metrics baseline across these domains:
	•	Delivery/DevEx: DORA (deploy freq, lead time, CFR, MTTR).
	•	Reliability/Ops: SLIs/SLOs, error-budget calc; Golden Signals dashboards; OpenTelemetry adoption.
	•	Performance: backend p50/p95/p99; frontend Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS).
	•	Security/Supply chain: OWASP ASVS control coverage; OWASP LLM Top-10 mitigations (if LLMs present); SLSA level; SBOM presence.
	•	Code quality/Architecture: quality-gate status; complexity & duplication; dependency cycles; coupling/instability; test coverage & mutation score; CI flake rate.
	•	AI orchestration (if applicable): RAGAS scores (faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision/recall), latency & cost per request; guardrail tests.
	•	UX/UI/A11y: HEART metrics (task-success, adoption/retention proxies), SUS score (if surveys exist), WCAG 2.2 AA issues backlog.
	•	Docs & versioning: Diátaxis completeness; link/diagrams/doctest pass; SemVer & Changelog hygiene.
	2.	Discover & measure by reading code, configs, CI, docs, and test artifacts. Generate scripts where needed (e.g., dependency graphs, complexity scans, Lighthouse run, mutator tests, SBOM).
	3.	Report & plan:
	•	Create GAP_ANALYSIS.md (table: Domain • Metric • Current • Target • Evidence • Risk).
	•	Create IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with a sequenced backlog: Now (0–2 weeks), Next (2–6 weeks), Later, each item with owner, effort, dependencies, and exit criteria.
	•	Under /docs/diagrams/, add Mermaid diagrams for critical flows (request lifecycle, data lineage, error handling, CI/CD).
	•	Update root docs (README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, RELEASE_NOTES) to match the plan; ensure all links pass.

Targets (encode as acceptance checks in the plan; adjust if infeasible):
	•	DORA: daily deploys; lead-time < 24 h; CFR ≤ 15%; MTTR < 1 h.
	•	SLOs + error budgets defined per service; Golden Signals dashboards wired.
	•	Web: LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 (p75 field).
	•	Security: ASVS L2 evidence; LLM Top-10 mitigations mapped; SLSA level stated; SBOM per build.
	•	Quality gate passes on new code; zero dependency cycles; mutation score ≥ 60% (raise over time).
	•	Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA issues triaged with fixes scheduled.
	•	Docs: Diátaxis-compliant ToC; link check & doctest green; updated CHANGELOG.

Safety & hygiene
	•	No behavioural changes without a PR. Open a planning/frontier-gap branch; commit scripts & reports.
	•	Add/extend CI jobs for link-check, doctest, Lighthouse (or CWV lab proxies), mutation testing, SBOM generation.
	•	For destructive moves (file deletes/renames), generate a change set and confirm in PR description.

Deliverables
	1.	GAP_ANALYSIS.md and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with cross-references to evidence.
	2.	/docs/diagrams/*.md (Mermaid) and updated root docs.
	3.	A draft PR with passing CI and a checklist mapping each frontier target to tests/dashboards.

Now run: auto-discover services, tests, pipelines, and docs; compute the baseline; propose the plan; then open the branch and commit the artefacts.

Why these criteria (evidence-gated)
	•	DORA’s four (now five including reliability) metrics remain the best-validated predictors of software delivery performance; elite teams report < 1 hour lead time and < 1 hour MTTR in recent years.  ￼
	•	Reliability work should be driven by SLOs, error budgets and the Golden Signals; this is canonical SRE practice.  ￼
	•	Front-end UX performance is anchored in Core Web Vitals with INP (since 12 Mar 2024) replacing FID; thresholds are LCP ≤ 2.5 s, INP ≤ 200 ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 at p75.  ￼
	•	Security baselines use OWASP ASVS for web apps and OWASP’s LLM Top-10 for AI-enabled systems.  ￼
	•	Code quality gates (maintainability, reliability, security, coverage/duplication) and complexity metrics are standardised via SonarQube and related tooling.  ￼
	•	Documentation quality and release hygiene are strengthened by Diátaxis, Semantic Versioning, and a curated changelog.  ￼
