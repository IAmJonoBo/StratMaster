# Internal Planning Documents

This directory contains internal planning documents, development notes, and project management materials that are not intended for end users or customers.

## Contents

- **Planning documents** - Development roadmaps, iteration plans, backlog items
- **Status reports** - Internal progress tracking and milestone reports  
- **Architecture decisions** - Technical decision records and design discussions
- **Project management** - Meeting notes, retrospectives, and process documentation

## Purpose

These documents are quarantined from the main documentation to ensure:

- Clean separation between user-facing and internal content
- Focused user experience without planning noise  
- Preserved internal context for development team
- Clear distinction between product documentation and project management

## Access

Internal documents are:

- **Not included in documentation builds** - Excluded from MkDocs site generation
- **Not indexed by search** - Kept out of user-facing search results
- **Version controlled** - Tracked in git for team access and history
- **Access controlled** - Available to development team only

## Migration Notes

These documents were moved from the main `docs/` directory during the documentation rebuild process to implement the Di√°taxis framework and create a clean, user-focused documentation experience.

Original locations and migration details are tracked in the project's documentation migration log.
