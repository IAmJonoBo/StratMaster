# StratMaster V2 Branch Consolidation Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the intelligent strategy to consolidate all development branches into a new 'V2' branch that will serve as the primary development branch for StratMaster's next major version. This consolidation aligns with the SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md modernization program and existing implementation issues.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Unified Development Stream**: Consolidate scattered development efforts into a coherent V2 architecture
2. **Implementation Alignment**: Execute the SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md 5-sprint modernization program
3. **Quality Foundation**: Establish automated quality gates and testing infrastructure
4. **Developer Experience**: Streamline onboarding and development workflows
5. **Production Readiness**: Prepare V2 for production deployment with feature flags

### Success Metrics (from SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md)
- âœ… 30% reduction in build pipeline duration
- âœ… 90% automated test coverage on core modules
- âœ… Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- âœ… 40% reduction in onboarding time

- âœ… **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit, trunk, pytest, CI/CD infrastructure
- âœ… **Sprint Plan**: Detailed 15-week modernization roadmap
- ðŸ”„ **Feature Flags**: Partially implemented, needs V2 integration
- ðŸ”„ **Testing Coverage**: Basic structure, needs expansion to 90%

## V2 Consolidation Plan

### Current Progress Variance (2025-09-25)
- V2 branch created and merged with `main` + codex branch (selective merge replaced full discovery automation).
- Feature flag scaffold added (`configs/v2-flags.example.json`, `feature_flags.py`).
- Issue synchronization artifacts generated (`create_github_issues.sh`, `github_cli_commands.txt`, `GITHUB_ISSUES_MANUAL.md`).
- Full automated branch discovery step deferred (manual consolidation deemed sufficient for initial baseline).
- Next planned: push `v2`, create issues via GH CLI, begin Sprint 0 baseline measurements.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Discovery (Week 1)
**Deliverables:**
- [x] V2 branch creation with consolidated code
- [x] Feature flag infrastructure for V2 components (scaffold)
- [x] Issue synchronization artifacts generated
- [ ] Comprehensive branch discovery and analysis (deferred)
- [ ] Base CI/CD pipeline for V2 branch (reuse main pipeline; optimization pending)
- [ ] Developer migration guide (TBD)

**Branch Consolidation Strategy:**
1. **Discovery**: Scan all remote branches for active development
2. **Classification**: Categorize branches by feature area and readiness
3. **Selective Merge**: Cherry-pick valuable commits into V2
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Automated resolution with manual review
5. **Testing**: Ensure V2 passes all existing tests

### Phase 2: Sprint 0 Implementation (Weeks 1-3)
**Aligns with SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md Sprint 0**

**Architecture Assessment & Baseline:**
- [ ] Automated architecture discovery and documentation
- [ ] Dependency inventory with security classification
- [ ] Test coverage baseline measurement
- [ ] CI/CD performance benchmarking

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for V2 module boundaries
- [ ] Dependency risk matrix with upgrade priorities
- [ ] Coverage heatmap and quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] V2 CI/CD benchmark report

### Phase 3: Modular Architecture (Weeks 4-6)
**Aligns with SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md Sprint 1**

**V2 Module Implementation:**
- [ ] Enhanced module boundaries with dependency injection
- [ ] Shared infrastructure layer (logging, config, auth)
- [ ] Updated developer tooling for V2 structure
- [ ] V2-specific documentation and migration guides

### Phase 4: Implementation Acceleration (Weeks 7-15)
**Implements remaining SM_REFACTOR_STRAT.md sprints**

**Priority Implementation Order:**
1. **P0-Critical (Immediate)**:
   - Real-time collaboration engine
   - Evidence-guided model recommender V2
   - Retrieval benchmarking & validation

2. **P1-Important (Weeks 2-4)**:
   - Advanced caching & performance optimization
   - Phase 3 UX quality gates

3. **P2-Enhancement (Month 2+)**:
   - Predictive strategy analytics
   - Event-driven microservices
   - Industry-specific templates
   - Custom model fine-tuning
   - Knowledge graph reasoning

## Implementation Tools

## V2 Development Workflow

### Developer Onboarding
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup V2 environment
git clone https://github.com/IAmJonoBo/StratMaster.git
cd StratMaster
git checkout v2
make bootstrap

# 2. Configure V2 feature flags
cp configs/v2-flags.example.json configs/v2-flags.json
# Edit flags for local development

# 3. Validate V2 setup
make v2.validate
PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1 .venv/bin/python -m pytest packages/api/tests/ -q

# 4. Start V2 development server
make v2.dev
```

### Feature Development Process
1. **Branch Creation**: `git checkout -b feature/v2-feature-name`
2. **Feature Flag**: Add feature flag for new functionality
3. **Implementation**: Develop with V2 architecture patterns
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e)
5. **Quality Gates**: Pass all automated quality checks
6. **PR Review**: Peer review with V2 architecture compliance
7. **Integration**: Merge to V2 with feature flag controls

### Quality Assurance
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code quality checks
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Multi-stage validation (lint, test, security, performance)
- **Feature Flag Testing**: A/B test new features before full rollout
- **Rollback Strategy**: Immediate rollback capability for any V2 component

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Merge Conflicts**: Automated conflict resolution with manual review fallback
2. **Breaking Changes**: Feature flags ensure backward compatibility
3. **Performance Regression**: Comprehensive benchmarking and monitoring
4. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Mandatory 90% coverage with automated enforcement

### Process Risks
1. **Developer Adoption**: Comprehensive migration guides and training
2. **Timeline Delays**: Phased rollout with MVP approach
3. **Quality Degradation**: Automated quality gates and rollback procedures
4. **Communication Gaps**: Automated progress reporting and dashboards

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] V2 branch successfully created with consolidated code
- [ ] All existing tests pass on V2 branch
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] 30% CI/CD performance improvement
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Feature flag system operational

### Process Metrics
- [ ] 40% reduction in developer onboarding time
- [ ] All 21 implementation issues tracked in GitHub
- [ ] Sprint milestones aligned with delivery schedule
- [ ] Automated quality gates preventing regressions
- [ ] Developer satisfaction > 8/10 (V2 workflow survey)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Execute Branch Consolidation**: Run automated branch discovery and consolidation
2. **Create V2 Branch**: Establish V2 as the primary development branch
3. **Setup Issue Tracking**: Create all 21 GitHub issues from templates
4. **Configure CI/CD**: Enable V2-specific build and deployment pipelines
5. **Developer Communication**: Announce V2 transition with migration timeline

### User Instructions for GitHub Issue Sync
Since direct GitHub issue creation requires repository write permissions, the following instructions will enable the user to synchronize all tracking issues:

**Manual GitHub Issue Creation:**
1. Navigate to https://github.com/IAmJonoBo/StratMaster/issues
2. For each file in `github_issues_ready/`:
   - Create new issue
   - Copy title and body from file
   - Apply suggested labels and milestones
   - Reference related issues for dependencies

**Automated Issue Creation (with GitHub CLI):**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not available
gh auth login

# Create all issues from templates
cd github_issues_ready
for issue_file in issue_*.md; do
  gh issue create --title "$(head -1 $issue_file)" --body-file "$issue_file" \
    --label "enhancement,SM_REFACTOR_STRAT,implementation"
done
```

This consolidation strategy ensures StratMaster V2 becomes a robust, modern, and maintainable platform while preserving existing functionality and accelerating future development.
