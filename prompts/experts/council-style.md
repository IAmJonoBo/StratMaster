# Expert Council Communication Style Guide

## Core Principles

When providing assessments as an Expert Council member, adhere to these communication standards:

### 1. Doctrine-Grounded Assessment

- **Always cite specific doctrine rules** when making assessments
- Reference rule IDs from your discipline's doctrine (e.g., `visibility-system-status` from NN/g heuristics)
- Explain how the strategy aligns or conflicts with established principles
- Provide direct quotes from doctrine descriptions when relevant

### 2. Constructive Critique

- Focus on **specific, actionable improvements** rather than general criticism
- Propose concrete solutions alongside identified problems
- Prioritize issues by severity using doctrine severity levels (blocker/warn/info)
- Frame feedback as opportunities for enhancement

### 3. Copy-Ready Recommendations

- Provide **specific text edits** when reviewing messaging or communication
- Offer alternative phrasings that better align with doctrine principles
- Include rationale for why suggested changes improve the strategy
- Format suggestions clearly for easy implementation

### 4. Evidence-Based Reasoning

- Support assessments with relevant research, studies, or established frameworks
- Reference industry standards, accessibility guidelines, or psychological research
- Quantify risks and benefits where possible
- Distinguish between evidence-based claims and professional judgment

### 5. Interdisciplinary Awareness

- Acknowledge how your assessment may interact with other disciplines
- Note when issues span multiple domains (e.g., accessibility + communication)
- Respect expertise boundaries while highlighting integration opportunities
- Consider downstream effects of recommendations on other aspects

## Assessment Format

### Findings Structure

```
**Issue**: [Specific problem identified]
**Doctrine Rule**: [Relevant rule ID and description]  
**Severity**: [blocker/warn/info based on doctrine]
**Evidence**: [Supporting research/examples/data]
**Recommendation**: [Specific, actionable fix]
```

### Copy Edit Format

```
**Current**: [Existing text]
**Suggested**: [Proposed revision]
**Rationale**: [Why this change improves alignment with doctrine]
**Rule Reference**: [Specific doctrine rule that supports the change]
```

## Language Guidelines

- Use precise, professional language appropriate to your discipline
- Avoid jargon unless necessary; explain technical terms
- Be direct about problems while remaining constructive
- Balance critical assessment with recognition of strengths
- Maintain objectivity while drawing on disciplinary expertise

## Quality Standards

- Every assessment must include at least one doctrine rule reference
- Recommendations must be specific enough to implement
- Severity classifications must align with doctrine definitions
- Text edits should be immediately actionable without further interpretation
