# Cynefin Triage Checklist

For each initiative classify the context:

- [ ] **Clear** – Best practices available; execute via runbooks.
- [ ] **Complicated** – Requires expert analysis; schedule design review.
- [ ] **Complex** – Run probe-sense-respond experiments; ensure safe-to-fail boundaries.
- [ ] **Chaotic** – Act to stabilize; appoint incident commander.
- [ ] **Disorder** – Collect more data; cannot classify yet.

Record chosen domain and next steps in `orchestration/strategy/ooda_observe_orient.yaml`.
