# Wardley Mapping Playbook

1. List user needs in priority order.
2. Map components along the value chain (visibility) and evolution stages (genesis â†’ commodity).
3. Identify climatic patterns (e.g., inertia, ecosystem plays).
4. Decide doctrine plays (e.g., focus on user needs, challenge assumptions).
5. Mark gameplay moves and owners; sync with OODA cadence.
