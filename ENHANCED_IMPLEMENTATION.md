- Adversarial testing capabilities
- Critic-based quality validation
- ML-powered outcome prediction

### Real-Time Collaboration
CRDT-based collaboration using Yjs provides:
- Conflict-free concurrent editing
- WebSocket-based real-time synchronization
- User presence and awareness features
- Scalable multi-user document editing

### Performance-First Design
All systems prioritize performance with:
- <2s page load times
- <150ms collaboration latency
- Quality gate enforcement
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## ðŸ”„ Feature Flags

Enhanced implementation uses feature flags for safe deployment:
- `ENABLE_COLLAB_LIVE`: Real-time collaboration features
- `ENABLE_MODEL_RECOMMENDER_V2`: Advanced model selection
- `ENABLE_RETRIEVAL_BENCHMARKS`: Quality-gated retrieval
- `INTEGRATIONS_AVAILABLE`: Export system integrations
